# NASA Mission Control

NASA Mission Control is a facility that manages space flights to habitable planets, usually from the point of launch until landing or the end of the mission. 

Using the Kepler data (via CSV file) from NASA, we are able to filter out and find exoplanets that are potentially habitable for humans. 

We are then able to set up a launch date, provide a mission name, rocket type and destination for space flight. 

With this simple data entry application that is built with Node.js, Express Framework, RESTful APIs (GraphQL coming soon) and React for the front end, you are able to input a launch date to an exoplanet, view upcoming and past missions. 

This is not an official site and is not affliated with NASA or SpaceX in any way.
